PURPOSE
This project came across my mind during my coop term. Our team came across the topic of language and I thought that it would be cool to create a program that would take an English word and print out the pronounciation of the word in another language. The project is still a work in progress, but it is definately coming along.

RESOURCE
In order to achieve the purpose of the project, I had to find out what each letter in the specified word sounded like. Because a single letter can have a different pronounciation depending on its context, I had to find a way to identify all possible pronounciations each letter can produce. That's when I came across a project by Carnegie Mellon University. The university team made a dictionary of English words with the corresponding characters that indicate the pronounciation of the words. The CMU dictionary has helped me become even more inspired and with the help of this public project, I was able to get a good start on my project.

ESL KOREAN
My roommate, Rachel Lo, a Systems-design engineering student at my school, helped me come up with the creative name of this project: ESL Korean.
ESL Korean can be pronounced in two ways.

English Second Language Korean, and
English Sounds Like Korean
Thanks to Rachel, I was able to give a very creative, descriptive, and witty name to the project!
